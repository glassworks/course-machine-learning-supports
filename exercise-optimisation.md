# Exercise : optimisation

Let's summarise what we know so far:

* We have a linear function that translates each value of x -> y (in our case, size -> price).
* This function is composed of two coefficients, **m** and **c**
* Given specific values of **m** and **c**, we can calculate the **cost** (or error) of our line with respect to our training data

Given this knowledge, our next step is logical. Try and find the values of **m** and **c** that **minimise the cost**.

Write some python code that will find the values for **m** and **c** that produce the minimum cost for training set, in the shortest amount of time.
